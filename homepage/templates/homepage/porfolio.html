  <div class= "about" id="about" >
   <p >I am a graduate of Hope College with a degree in Computer Science and minor in Physics.  I have loved science from childhood and want to apply my computer skills during a summer internship.<p>
    <p >Last summer I worked at a medical device company in greater Chicago.  I developed Labview software that automated the testing of medical pumps.  I enjoyed the job very much but my parents moved to Portland, Oregon so I am looking for something that would allow me to live at home.<p>

    <p >My interest in programming started in elementary school when I took a class on how to write software to create computer games.  I also have a keen interest in robotics that was sparked by completing a LEGO mindstorms class.</p>

    <p >I have done some cellular phone testing during high school.  I tried to find areas where automated testing would catch failures.  I operated the testing and recorded the failure rates.</p>

        <p >I am creative and enjoy doing home projects.  I have created a Halloween costume with wearable LED glasses. I enjoyed all aspects, from soldering to working out the circuit design. </p>

        <p >I am a detailed oriented problem solver and good team player.  I get a kick out of solving technical problems.  I enjoy digging into the core of technology and using that knowledge to solve problems and come up with new applications.</p>
